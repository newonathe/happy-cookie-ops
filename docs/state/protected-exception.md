# MP-02 protected exception request

Status: OWNER APPROVED in the 2026-09-08 conversation and applied exactly as proposed. Valid return bodies remain unchanged.

Current tsc reports 14 TS18047 diagnostics in add-inv, edit-price, inv-edit, why and proof. Engine miscVals returns sheet null without sh.kind; ordersVals returns od null without a selected order. The declared nullability is accurate. Parent checks do not carry into independently typed component function bodies.

Proposed exact patch: [five guards](evidence/MP-02-protected-null-guards.patch). One guard per component before return. Valid rendering, copy, styles, element order and event handlers remain byte-identical; invalid missing-data rendering still throws, now explicitly before dereference. No business rule or engine change. Existing port baseline needs no update because return bodies do not change.

Rule requiring the owner's decision: AGENTS.md Do not touch, src/components/sheets/**, and user section 12 expressly prohibit protected source edits without a narrow exception. Alternative of claiming these values always exist would be a false type contract. Verification after approval: tsc, pnpm verify/build, unchanged return-body hashes, focused invalid-data guards and headless valid-sheet captures. Rollback removes only the five inserted lines.
